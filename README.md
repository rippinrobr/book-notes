# Book Notes

I've found that my retention level goes through the roof when I write notes as I read tech books. I've been writing notes on paper for awhile
but I always seem to lose or misplace them when I need them the most so I've decided to create gitbooks.  Since I find them helpful maybe you 
will also, so I thought I'd share.  This project is sparse now but it will continue to grow.
